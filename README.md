# Weather Dashboard

An interactive weather dashboard that shows you the current weather and a 5 day forecast

## Description

Type a city into the search bar and see the current weather as well as a 5-day forecast. Once you've searched for a city, it saves that city into your local storage and will be displayed under the search bar for convenience. If you click on a city that you've already searched for, it will display the stats for that city.
